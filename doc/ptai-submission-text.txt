Hi Vincent,

Please find attached our extended abstract “WHAT IS COGNITION IF NOT INTERACTION?”; thanks so much for considering it for this year’s PT-AI event.

1. Communicating author – me [j. mark bishop] (m.bishop@gold.ac.uk)
2. John Howroyd - J.Howroyd@gold.ac.uk
3. Andrew Martin – A.Martin@gold.ac.uk

All three authors (cc’d to this) are based at TCIDA, Goldsmiths, University of London, New Cross, London.

Briefly, in this paper (its title, a nod to ‘Port and van Gelder’, of course) we demonstrate [for the first time] progress towards developing a swarm intelligence algorithm - based on interacting communicating processes - that is Turing complete. I think this is a relatively an important result – not least as the core principle underlying the interacting processes are (a) analogous to the behaviour of certain [tandem running] ant species (in nest/resource location tasks) and (b) are based on communications NOT computations (although, of course, they can be described [and simulated] computationally); the latter feature, positions out work in a different class to both Siegelmann and Sontag’s Turing Complete RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), and the Google/DeepMind team (of Grave, Wayne & Danihelka) 2014 NTM (Neural Turing Machine), both of which remain implicitly – if not explicitly - grounded on computational processes (summations, multiplications, activation-functions etc.).

Cheers,
- mark
